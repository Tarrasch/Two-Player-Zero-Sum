Two Player Zero-Sum Games

To run the program that calculates the best (and same) strategies
for the two players, just execute playgame.m. (F5).

This is the output I get:

    Player 1 should play according to:
       -0.0000
        0.0625
        0.3125
        0.2500
        0.3125
        0.0625

    And player 2 should play according to:
        0.0000
        0.0625
        0.3125
        0.2500
        0.3125
        0.0625
